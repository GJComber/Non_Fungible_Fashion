# Introduction

This app provides a Streamlit based user interface where the  user gets to choose between multiple items and this app mints a Non Fungible Token with the purchase of a physical product. The NFT is then transferred to user defind wallet address. 

This project has a Streamlit UI to buy designer products which mints a Non Fungible Token (NFT) as proof of ownership generated with the purchase of that product. The NFT transfers to the users specified wallet address.

# Concept

Fintech startup 'Non Fungible Fashion' has developed a prototype
stage user interface to demonstrate the security and quality of life benefits an anti-
counterfeit tool can implement. A measure such as this can decrease the illegal trade of
fakes, aiming to minimise the frustrations of a loyal customer and maximise the
profits for the producer of authentic high-end goods across a globe-spanning,
evolving market, all in real-time.
