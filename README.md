# Introduction

This project provides a Streamlit based user interface where the  user gets to choose between multiple items and this app mints a Non Fungible Token with the purchase of a physical product. The NFT is then transferred to a user defined wallet address. 

Direct from the Streamlit UI the user can buy designer products which mint a Non Fungible Token (NFT) as proof of ownership generated with the purchase of that product. The NFT transfers to the users specified wallet address.

# Concept

Fintech startup 'Non Fungible Fashion' has developed a prototype
stage user interface to demonstrate the security and quality of life benefits an anti-
counterfeit tool can implement. A measure such as this can decrease the illegal trade of
fakes, aiming to minimise the frustrations of a loyal customer and maximise the
profits for the producer of authentic high-end goods across a globe-spanning,
evolving market, all in real-time.

## Non Fungible Tokens in High-end Fashion market

The high end luxury good market is worth USD 349.1 Billion in 2022 which will grow at a CAGR rate of 3.7% making it worth USD419 Billion in 2027. Per year about USD 30 Billion is lost due to counterfeit items and having an NFT as a proof of purchase will make it hard for people to profit from fake goods. NFT will not only validate the authenticity of the goods but it will also provide an excellent opportunity
