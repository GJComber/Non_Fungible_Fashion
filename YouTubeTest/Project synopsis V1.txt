Streamlit UI as D'app
- assuming customer is logged in (with personal data such as delivery address 
etc built in & would have option of purchase as guest in D'app.) 
Can include this as buttons for visual effect

Customer can browse for items to buy seeing pics with a description
Customer can exchange crypto or cash for our coins into their wallet 
(Enter wallet id or from dropdown list)
(enter value to exchange)
They use these coins to buy the product which comes with its unique NFT.
This way they discretely pay gas for nft minting within the price.
Coins come out of the wallet and NFT goes in. 
Confirmation of purchase. (Hash?)
